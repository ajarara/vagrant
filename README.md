# Personal vagrant config

Reproducible-ish. Based on fedora, but most configuration is done through guix. Eventually we'll run guix all the way down, but there's no working guest additions packaged neatly. This at least is quick enough to hack together in a weekend.

# Install
- get vagrant on any virtualbox capable host
- clone this repo
- vagrant up and hack
